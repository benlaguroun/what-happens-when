When you type "google.com" into your web browser's address bar and press Enter, several things happen:

DNS Resolution: The browser needs to find the IP address associated with the domain name "google.com." It does this by performing a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. The DNS server returns the IP address of the server hosting Google's website.

HTTP Request: Once the browser has the IP address, it sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server asking for the content of the "google.com" webpage.

Server Processing: The server receives the request and processes it. In the case of Google's homepage, the server generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that makes up the webpage.

Client Rendering: The browser receives the response from the server, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It then renders the webpage, displaying the Google homepage on your screen.

Additional Requests: The initial webpage may include references to additional resources such as images, stylesheets, or scripts. The browser issues additional requests for these resources to fully load and render the webpage.

User Interaction: Now, you can interact with the Google homepage. You can enter search queries, click on links, or use other features provided by the website.

In summary, typing "google.com" and pressing Enter initiates a series of actions, involving DNS resolution, server requests, processing, and client-side rendering, ultimately leading to the display of the Google homepage in your web browser.
